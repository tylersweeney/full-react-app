        My name is Tyler Sweeney and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer.
        I have 3 years experience building full application front to back. 
        I specialize in MERN stack builds, but am experienced in many coding languages. 
        I also have experience with SEO and online advertising.

        I began programming in 2015 with two Python classes at Orange Coast College. 
        I completed my Full-Stack Web Developer certification in April 2018. 
        A gamer since a young age when every game had to be launched from DOS, 
        my first interaction with programming was terminal commands.

        In my free time I have been learning C++ and the Unreal Engine. 
        Industries that I am passionate about being a part of are 
        Gaming, Music, Entertainment, Business, Real Estate, and Sports.
